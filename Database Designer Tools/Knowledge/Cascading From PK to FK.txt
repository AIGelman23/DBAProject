USING "ON DELETE CASCADE" AND "ON UPDATE CASCADE" >>> (!! PK MUST EXIST !!)

BOTH PRIMARY AND FOREIGN KEYS MUST BE 'NOT NULL' AND MUST BE SAME DATATYPE EX. BIGINT (BUT PRIMARY KEY CAN 
BE OF INCREMENT TYPE IN THIS SITUATION). 


YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEN USING REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY TO ASSIGN A PRIMARY KEY TO ONE TABLE 
AND A FOREIGN KEY TO ANOTHER THAT YOU PUT 

1 RECORD IN THE PRIMARY TABLE (MEANING ALL FIELDS FILLED OUT OR WITH A NULL VALUE IF EXCEPTED)

AND 

1 RECORD IN THE FOREIGN TABLE (MEANING ALL FIELDS FILLED OUT OR WITH A NULL VALUE IF EXCEPTED)

AFTER THIS IS DONE YOU CAN USE REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY USING 

EXAMPLE:

ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder
FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);

AFTER THIS IS DONE YOU CAN THEN TEST BY UPDATING THE PRIMARY KEY FIELD WITHIN THE PRIMARY TABLE (FIRST
TABLE CREATED) USING THE FOLLOWING:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

IF THE VALUES FOR THE PRIMARY AND FOREIGN KEY MATCH THAN THE REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY AND (ON DELETE CASCADE / 
ON UPDATE CASCADE) ARE WORKING CORRECTLY.
